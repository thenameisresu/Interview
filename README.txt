program1: 
prime number
program2: 
return the num of duplicate elements in a vector
program3: 
return the num of unique elements in a vector 
program4: 
pair of elements in an array whose sum is equal to K 
program6: 
Write a function that will do search and replace in input string by accepting array of search keywords and array of replace keywords. For example, 
          a)Input string: “Thisisasampleparagraphthatisgoingtobechangedtosomethingelse”
          Searchtokens: {“is”, “paragraph”}
          Replacetokens: {“was”, “story”}
          Output: “Thwaswasasamplestorythatwasgoingtobechangedtosomethingelse ”
          b)Input string: “thisisrepalceprogram”
          Searchtokens: {“is”}
          Replacetokens: {“was”}
          Output:- “thiswasrepalceprogram.”
program7:
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays. You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.
          a)Input:- nums1 = [1, 2]
                    nums2 = [3, 4]
          Output: - Median is (2+3/2) = 2.5 in above case.
          b)Input:- nums1 = [1, 3]
                    nums2 = [2]
          Output: - The median is 2.0
          c)Input:-	nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
                    nums2 = [0, 5, 6, 9]
          Output: - The median is 4.0
          Write a function which will take input as two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 and will return median for them.
          
program8:
Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head. Note: - Given n will always be valid.
          a)Input: - Link list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
            Output: - 1->2->3->5
          b)Input: - Link list: 11->22->33->40->50, and n = 3.
            Output: - 1->2->3->5
          c)Input: - Link list: 5->6->7, and n = 1.
            Output: - 5->6
program9:
find the square root of a number without using predefined function.
